                <p>The Yanomami live in one large communal building called a shabono or yano.
                    These can house up to 400 people! They sleep in hammocks near the fire at night.
                    Each family has its own hearth to prepare and cook food. The central area feasts, rituals, games,
                    and other community activities.</p>

                <p>The Yanomami have a different way of understanding what we call "nature."
                    In their language Urihi a - forest-land - is a living entity that is part of a
                    complex dynamic relationship between human and non-human beings, such as animals, plants and others.
